## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(shiny)
library(maps)
library(mapproj)
counties <- readRDS("data/counties.rds")
source("helpers.R")

shinyServer(
  function(input, output) {
    output$map <- renderPlot({
      args <- switch(input$var,
                     "Percent White" = list(counties$white, "darkgreen", "% White"),
                     "Percent Black" = list(counties$black, "black", "% Black"),
                     "Percent Hispanic" = list(counties$hispanic, "darkorange", "% Hispanic"),
                     "Percent Asian" = list(counties$asian, "darkviolet", "% Asian"))
      
      args$min <- input$range[1]
      args$max <- input$range[2]
      
      do.call(percent_map, args)
    })
  }
)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("censusVis"),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      helpText("Create demographic maps with 
               information from the 2010 US Census."),
      
      selectInput("var", 
                  label = "Choose a variable to display",
                  choices = c("Percent White", "Percent Black",
                              "Percent Hispanic", "Percent Asian"),
                  selected = "Percent White"),
      
      sliderInput("range", 
                  label = "Range of interest:",
                  min = 0, max = 100, value = c(0, 100))
      ),
    
    mainPanel(plotOutput("map"))
  )
))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
